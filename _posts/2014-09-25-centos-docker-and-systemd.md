Over the last few weeks, we've been asked about using _systemd_ inside the
CentOS-7 Docker containers for more complex operation. Because _systemd_ offers
a number of rather nice features, I can completely understand why people want
to use it rather than pulling in outside tools like _supervisord_ to recreate
what already exists in CentOS Linux by default. Unfortunately, it's just not that
easy. 

There are a couple of major reasons why we don't include _systemd_ by default in
the base Docker image. Dan Walsh covered these pretty completely in a [blog
post](http://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/05/05/running-systemd-within-docker-container/), 
but to recap where we are currently, let's hit the highlights

 * _systemd_ requires the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. This means running docker with `--privileged`. Not good for a base image.
 * _systemd_ requires access to the `cgroups` filesystem. 
 * _systemd_ has a number of unit files that don't matter in a container, and they cause errors if they're not removed.

It's for these reasons that we ship with _fakesystemd_ in the default image. The
_fakesystemd_ package provides dependency resolution and the proper directory
structure so that packages install normally, and individual apps can be run
inside the container by default. The _fakesystemd_ package isn't really an
elegant fix, but it's currently the best we can do in the base images. As soon
as we're able to rip it out and ship a proper _systemd_ package, we will. 

If you're okay with running your container with `--privileged`, then you can
follow the steps below to create your _systemd_ enabled Docker image from the
CentOS-7 base image.

### Dockerfile for _systemd_ base image

    FROM centos:centos7
    MAINTAINER "you" <your@email.here>
    ENV container docker
    RUN yum -y swap -- remove fakesystemd -- install systemd systemd-libs
    RUN yum -y update; yum clean all; \
    (cd /lib/systemd/system/sysinit.target.wants/; for i in *; do [ $i ==
    systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service ] || rm -f $i; done); \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/*;\
    rm -f /etc/systemd/system/*.wants/*;\
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/*; \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/*udev*; \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/*initctl*; \
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/basic.target.wants/*;\
    rm -f /lib/systemd/system/anaconda.target.wants/*;
    VOLUME [ "/sys/fs/cgroup" ]
    CMD ["/usr/sbin/init"]

This Dockerfile swaps out _fakesystemd_ for the real deal, but deletes a bunch
of the unit files we don't need. Building this image gives us a usable base to
start from. 

    docker build --rm -t centos7-systemd . 

### _systemd_ enabled app container

Once this new base image is built, we can move on to building stuff that
actually needs _systemd_. In this instance we'll use _httpd_ as an example. 

    FROM centos7-systemd
    RUN yum -y install httpd; yum clean all; systemctl enable httpd.service
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD ["/usr/sbin/init"]

We build once again:

    docker build --rm -t centos7-systemd/httpd

To put this all together and run _httpd_ with systemd in Docker, we do this:

    docker run â€“privileged -ti -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro -p 80:80 centos7-systemd/httpd

This container is running with _systemd_ in a limited context, but it must
always be run as a privileged container with the cgroups filesystem mounted.

There are plenty of rumors circulating that this will be addressed in the
future, either in _systemd_ or in a _systemd_-like subpackage. As soon as we're
able to ship _systemd_ in the base image, we will do so.
